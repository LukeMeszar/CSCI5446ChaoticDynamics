Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
  But if thou live remembered not to be

Thou dost beguile the world

Of his self-love to stop posterity

Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
Calls back the lovely April of her prime

Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest

Now is the time that face should form another

Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
unbless some mother.
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest

So thou through windows of thine age shalt see

  Die single and thine image dies with thee.
