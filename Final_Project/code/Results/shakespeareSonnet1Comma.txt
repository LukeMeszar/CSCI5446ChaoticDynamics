And only herald to the gaudy spring
by the grave and thee.

Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel
That thereby beauty's rose might never die
But as the riper should by time decease
That thereby beauty's rose might never die
But as the riper should by time decease
That thereby beauty's rose might never die
by the grave and thee.

Making a famine where abundance lies
From fairest creatures we desire increase
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
But as the riper should by time decease
That thereby beauty's rose might never die
