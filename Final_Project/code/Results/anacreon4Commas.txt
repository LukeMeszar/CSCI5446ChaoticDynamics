She will teach me how to die
Can flowery breeze
with blush of fire
Himself shall hover by my side
No
no; I ask no balm to steep
With fragrant tears my bed of sleep:
But now
ere my soul retire
To join the blest elysian choir
And minister the racy tide
Where lotos with the myrtle weaves;
And while in luxury's dream I sink
round his snowy breast
and blisses dear
Cupid
Now let me breathe the balsam flowing;
Now let the rose
With wine
Upon my brow its scent expire;
And bring the nymph with floating eye
I'll make my own elysium here
Strew me a breathing bed of leaves
to feed the wind
With cinctures
Oh
and love
Young Love shall be my goblet-boy;
Folding his little golden vest
Our life is hurrying to the goal:
A scanty dust
Let me the balm of Bacchus drink
In this delicious hour of joy
Affect the slumbering chill of death
Yes
Swift as the wheels that kindling roll
or odour's breath
Is all the trace 'twill leave behind.
Why do we shed the rose's bloom
Upon the cold insensate tomb
while every pulse is glowing
