When I behold thee
And a strong trembling
Utterance leaves me;
As the adventurous
Thy silver speech-tones
Yet must I, greatly
Runs through my body;
Sits and hears close to him
Who in thy presence
Lays hold upon me;
Ah, but the heart flutters
Even a moment;
Half dead for madness.
Fabulous islands,
Drawn by the lure of
Peer of the gods he seems,
Daring, adore thee,
For the lost sky-line
And the sea's secret.
And lovely laughter.
I flush with fever,
A subtle fire
My tongue is useless;
My eyes are sightless,
Sailor makes seaward
Under my bosom,
Beauty and summer
And undiscovered
Paler than grass am I,
And my ears ringing;
