And bring the nymph with floating eye,â€”
Upon my brow its scent expire;
Swift as the wheels that kindling roll,
And while in luxury's dream I sink,
With cinctures, round his snowy breast,
To join the blest elysian choir,
Is all the trace 'twill leave behind.
With fragrant tears my bed of sleep:
Yes, Cupid! ere my soul retire,
Himself shall hover by my side,
With wine, and love, and blisses dear,
Folding his little golden vest,



Oh! she will teach me how to die!
I'll make my own elysium here!
Upon the cold insensate tomb?
No, no; I ask no balm to steep
Our life is hurrying to the goal:
Now let me breathe the balsam flowing;
Now let the rose, with blush of fire,
Young Love shall be my goblet-boy;
Strew me a breathing bed of leaves,
Let me the balm of Bacchus drink!
In this delicious hour of joy,
But now, while every pulse is glowing,
A scanty dust, to feed the wind,
And minister the racy tide!
Why do we shed the rose's bloom
Where lotos with the myrtle weaves;
Affect the slumbering chill of death?
Can flowery breeze, or odour's breath,
