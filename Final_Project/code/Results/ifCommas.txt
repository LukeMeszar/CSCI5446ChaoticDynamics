There might be some sense
But I’d be in suspense
For on such a pretense
You wouldn’t be you.

If fear was plucky
If freckles were lovely

For if here was there
We wouldn’t be we.

Life would be delight

And measles were nice and a lie warn’t a lie

Yet they’d all despair
and day was night
and globes were square

And past was present
and false was true
But things couldn’t go right
For in such a sad plight
I wouldn’t be I.

If earth was heaven and now was hence

And dirt was cleanly and tears were glee
Things would seem fair
