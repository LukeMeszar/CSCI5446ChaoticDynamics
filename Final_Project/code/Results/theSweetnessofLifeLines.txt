And the branch√®d asters dream?
Seemed happy even as I;
"Why are ye all so happy?"
The loosestrife burns like ruby,
A various space and die;
"We are born, we are reared, and we linger
That o'er the sun-blanched wall
What sayest thou, Oh shadow,
That from the dreaming hill
And then of myself I questioned,
Stood from me and calmly answered,
Thou dream'st and art strangely happy,
I cried, and they answered me.
And what say ye, red roses,
And thou, Oh murmuring brooklet,
Liest so sharp and still?
All down the broadening valley
Thine own short space and die;
It fell on a day I was happy,
Thy misty marguerites are?
And I stretched my hands to the meadow,
"We are born, we are reared, and we linger
That like a ghost the while
Like flame or blood-drops fall?
To the bird, the beast, the tree:
The flowers and the beasts in the meadow
A various space and die;
What sayest thou, Oh meadow,
"Thou art born as the flowers, and wilt linger
And the winds, the concave sky,
That stretches so wide, so far,
We dream and are very happy,
From your high black-shadowed trellis
But we cannot answer why."
Whereby in the noonday gleam
But we cannot answer why."
That none can say how many
With slow and curious smile:
We dream, and are bright and happy,
But thou canst not answer why."
