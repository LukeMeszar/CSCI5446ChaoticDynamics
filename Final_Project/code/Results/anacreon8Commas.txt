'twas plain they envied me.
And still I flew—and now I caught
The panting nymphs
I seem'd to trace the opening lawn;
Light
Dimpled girls and ruddy boys
All were gone
Bright visions o'er my fancy play'd
and sported as we flew
'Sleep
let me dream them o'er and o'er
Saw me trip the flowery wild
With dimpled girls
again my joys restore
But
Some ruddy striplings
'Alas
and fondly thought
To kiss—when all my dream of joys
Sighing for the illusions fled
ah
Oh
on tiptoe bathed in dew
Twas night
With virgins blooming as the dawn
With blush of Bacchus on their cheek
I said
and slily smiled;
Smiled indeed with wanton glee
and many a circling bowl
Had deeply warmed my swimming soul;
As lull'd in slumber I was laid
We flew
young and sleek
