Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
Calls back the lovely April of her prime,
Now is the time that face should form another,
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
  But if thou live remembered not to be,
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
Of his self-love to stop posterity?
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
  Die single and thine image dies with thee.
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
