And set my teeth in the silver of the moon
I will take the sun in my mouth
I will rise
i will wade out
lipping
Alive
till my thighs are steeped in burning flowers
and leap into the ripe air
to dash against darkness
with chasteness of sea-girls
Will i complete the mystery
of my flesh
flowers
with closed eyes
in the sleeping curves of my body
Shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
After a thousand years
