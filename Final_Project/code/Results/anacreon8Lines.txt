And still I flew—and now I caught
All were gone! 'Alas!' I said,
I seem'd to trace the opening lawn;
Twas night, and many a circling bowl
To kiss—when all my dream of joys,
With virgins blooming as the dawn,
But, ah! 'twas plain they envied me.
Sighing for the illusions fled,
With dimpled girls, and slily smiled;
With blush of Bacchus on their cheek,
We flew, and sported as we flew!
Bright visions o'er my fancy play'd!
'Sleep! again my joys restore,
As lull'd in slumber I was laid,

Oh! let me dream them o'er and o'er!'
Had deeply warmed my swimming soul;
Dimpled girls and ruddy boys,
Smiled indeed with wanton glee,
Light, on tiptoe bathed in dew,
The panting nymphs, and fondly thought
Some ruddy striplings, young and sleek,
Saw me trip the flowery wild
