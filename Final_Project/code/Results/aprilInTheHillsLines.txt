The fields are full of little lakes,
And waters dancing everywhere;
The water ruffles blue and shakes,
With lifted brow and upward eyes.
Till earth and I are one.
And far from care and strife
In steady fleets serene and white,
The happy clouds go on.
The hillsides and the woodland ways,
The bluebird dips with flashing wings,
The shore-lark drops his brittle song;
About the meadows all day long
The nut-hatch runs, and nods, and clings;
I bathe my spirit in blue skies,
I feel the sun upon my hands;
A wanderer in enchanted lands,
I match the bluebird in her mirth;
The crows go by, a noisy throng;
I waken with the wakening earth;
To-day the world is wide and fair
The noon is builded high with light,
The snow is almost gone;
The robin flutes, the sparrow sings,
And taste the springs of life.
The broad earth bids me forth. I rise
And when the romping wind awakes
And wild with wind and sun,
The rivers burst and fill;
And the swallows float and flee.
A treasurer of immortal days,
I break the spirit's cloudy bands,
I roam the glorious world with praise,
And the pines roar on the hill.
And over heaven's liquid height,
The channels run, the bare earth steams,
And up the leafless tree
With sunny fields of lucid air,
I feel the tumult of new birth;
And every hollow rings and gleams
With jetting falls and dashing streams;
