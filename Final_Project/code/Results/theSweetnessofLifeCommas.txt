"We are born

I cried
we are reared

"We are born
and are bright and happy
and wilt linger
Thine own short space and die;
Thou dream'st and art strangely happy

That stretches so wide
and they answered me.
What sayest thou

The flowers and the beasts in the meadow
Seemed happy even as I;
And I stretched my hands to the meadow
and we linger
A various space and die;
We dream and are very happy
the tree:
"Why are ye all so happy
we are reared

And the branch√®d asters dream

And what say ye

That none can say how many
Thy misty marguerites are

That from the dreaming hill
All down the broadening valley
Liest so sharp and still
the beast
so far

That o'er the sun-blanched wall
From your high black-shadowed trellis
Like flame or blood-drops fall

But thou canst not answer why."


And the winds

But we cannot answer why."
And then of myself I questioned

That like a ghost the while
Stood from me and calmly answered
the concave sky

But we cannot answer why."
What sayest thou

With slow and curious smile:
"Thou art born as the flowers
It fell on a day I was happy
Oh shadow
Oh murmuring brooklet

To the bird

And thou

Whereby in the noonday gleam
The loosestrife burns like ruby
Oh meadow
red roses
and we linger
A various space and die;
We dream
