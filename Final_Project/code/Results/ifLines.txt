If earth was heaven and now was hence,
If freckles were lovely, and day was night,
But things couldn’t go right
There might be some sense
For on such a pretense
And measles were nice and a lie warn’t a lie,

And past was present, and false was true,

I wouldn’t be I.
Life would be delight,—
For if here was there
Yet they’d all despair,
For in such a sad plight
If fear was plucky, and globes were square,
We wouldn’t be we.
And dirt was cleanly and tears were glee
You wouldn’t be you.
Things would seem fair,—
But I’d be in suspense
