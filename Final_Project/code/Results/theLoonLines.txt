Which fall from loose-bound sheaves,

The thought of an alien race,
Is telling itself to our sight,
But the moon in her wayward beauty
All round us the secret of Nature
Can know the full mystery of night.
And the freighted year must close.
In light, on the smooth, wet sand;
Which drop from an overblown rose,
Softly the water ripples
As lovely as when upon Latmos
She watched till Endymion came.

As the water takes and leaves,
What does she in this pale, northern garden,
Or like the snow-white petals
Is ever and always the same,
Softly the moon glints and glistens
The child of a southern people,
Like golden ears of corn
We may guess at her meaning but never
When Summer ripens to Autumn

How reconcile it with her grace?
They endure for a moment, and vanish,
And the manifold whisper of leaves.
Made up of the murmur of waves

A proud white statue glimmers

But her power of enchantment is on us,
From the shore come the scents of a garden,
In cold, disdainful ease.
Softly the birch trees rustle

Through the water the moon writes her legends

And no one may understand.
Against the canoe's curving side,
Flinging over us branches wide.
We bow to the spell which she weaves,
And between a gap in the trees
