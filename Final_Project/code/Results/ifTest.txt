You wouldn’t be you.



For on such a pretense

But things couldn’t go right

But I’d be in suspense

We wouldn’t be we.

There might be some sense

And measles were nice and a lie warn’t a lie,

Life would be delight,—

For in such a sad plight

If fear was plucky, and globes were square,

And dirt was cleanly and tears were glee

I wouldn’t be I.

Things would seem fair,—

Yet they’d all despair,

For if here was there

If freckles were lovely, and day was night,

And past was present, and false was true,



If earth was heaven and now was hence,
