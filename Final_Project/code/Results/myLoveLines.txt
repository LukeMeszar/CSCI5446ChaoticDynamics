the king whereof is darkness

my love
thy legs are the trees of dreaming

upon the bough of thy body
of the cool jewel of thy mind
in whose armpits is the approach of spring
in whose kiss is the combinings of kings
filled with sleeping birds

of bells comprehended through incense
thy breasts are swarms of white bees
thy thighs are white horses yoked to a chariot
of silver
thy hair is one kingdom

thy hair upon thy shoulders is an army
of kings
innocent of defeat
thy forehead is a flight of flowers
thy wrists
whose fruit is the very eatage of forgetfulness
thy head is a quick forest
between them is always a pleasant song
thy eyes are the betrayal
in thy beauty is the dilemma of flutes
are holy
thy feet upon thy ankles are flowers in vases
the hair of thy head is one warrior
with victory and with trumpets
my love
which are the keepers of the keys of thy blood
thy lips are satraps in scarlet

thy body to me is April

they are the striking of a good minstrel

thy head is a casket
