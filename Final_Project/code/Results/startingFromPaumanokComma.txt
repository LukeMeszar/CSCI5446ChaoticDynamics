The rude fence
the unseen and the seen;
Mysterious ocean where the streams empty;
Prophetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering around me;
Living beings
sat on her nest in the briars
cities

Your ambition or business
to be ready for them
without religion;
Nor land

I take to your reckless and composite chords—I add to them

And that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles

I cannot be discharged from you—not from one
the passionate ones

The ever-tending
ploughing farms—See miners
from among them
adhere to me;
Of all the men of the earth

Land of the pastoral plains
the hunter's hut
O
to Sitka
I sing.
My comrade

Land of the herd

These ostensible realities

Well-begotten

Toward the male of the States

After what they have done to me
the double Carolinian
and Minnesota;
Chants going forth from the centre
a hundred millions;
One generation playing its part
priests
century marches

For me an audience interminable.
With firm and regular step they wend—they never stop

Far from the clank of crowds
politics
preparing unprecedented waves and storms.
See
demanded of me.
Not he with a daily kiss onward from childhood kissing me
Has winded and twisted around me that which holds me to him

Martyrs

Any more than such are to religion.
What do you seek
Massachusetts land
to the land
I have arrived
it may be turned to
beautiful results—and I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful
        than death;
And I will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are
        compact
Mexican-breezed
(moving awhile among it;)
Think nothing can ever be greater—nothing can ever deserve more than it
        deserves;
Regarding it all intently a long while
solid
or at noon

Or if there is
outlawed offenders—for I scan you with kindred eyes

Walking New England
Illinois
how real
the rocks and sands.All hold spiritual joys
musical
O that the great masters might return and study me
with original energy.
Take my leaves

Yet returning eastward—yet in the Sea-Side State
the experienced sisters and the
        inexperienced sisters
for good or bad—I permit to speak
me

Crossing the prairies—dwelling again in Chicago—dwelling in every town

Land of boatmen and sailors

Make welcome for them everywhere
O music wild
nor life worthy the name
Ottawa
and the modern reports.
This
beef
Land of the apple and
        grape
the claim
so pensive and silent
singing in the West
incessant and branching;
A new race
to listen
the garden
two greatnesses—and a third one

For those who belong here
and pass to
        fitting spheres
inaugurate a Religion—I too
        go to the wars;
It may be I am destined to utter the loudest cries thereof
do you concentrate in me—for I am determined
        to tell you with courageous clear voice
new literatures and religions
or of the
        Narragansett Bay State
or desolate
duly returned; See the strong and quick locomotive
to vivify all.
In the Year 80 of the States
the
        compact
after due long-waiting

It is well—Against such I say not a word—I am their poet also;
But behold
haste on
but never forgotten.)
I harbour
but arise; You oceans that have been calm within me
artists
See
that we know
        not of;
Contact daily and hourly that will not release me;
These selecting—these
in hints

Land of coal and iron
rain
will now shake out carols stronger and
        haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon earth.
I will make the songs of passion
Saginaw
exultant
I am yet of you unseen

Of your real body

Hoping to cease not till death.
Creeds and schools in abeyance

Another generation playing its part
Leaving natural breaths
the indissoluble compacts
nor all sent back by the echoes;
But subtle
emerge
it will elude the hands of the corpse-cleaners
For ever and for ever—longer than soil is brown and solid—longer than water ebbs and flows.I will make the poems of materials
it came to me that what he really sang for was not
        there only
calls as of birds and animals in the woods
snow
Michigan
to Aliaska;
Yet a true son either of Maine
breeds
thoughts
the wigwam
inland
I say it is just as important to you
with tools—See

What do you need
beasts

I stand in my place
forbidding
with firm holding—yet haste
feeding on short curly grass; See
says

I
and between any two of them;
And I will make a song for the ears of the President

O all and each well-loved by me
Chattahoochee
flowing through ages—now reaching hither

Yes
Land of sierras and peaks
— To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres
Read the hints come at last.
O Camerado close

O warblings under the sun—ushered
I pronounce what the air holds of the red aborigines.
The red aborigines
America
the winner's
        pealing shouts;
Who knows
rapt and happy;
Aware of the fresh free giver
with my own day
busy at their benches

Why
then dismissing it
and all the stars in the sky
Iowa
each for its kind
rice
to be their companion and equal—coming
        personally to you now;
Enjoining you to acts
O I at any rate
include you all with perfect love
See in my poems immigrants continually coming and landing; See in arriere
and joyfully singing.And while I paused
from the
        swamp-cedars
riches

        mystery

Land of the ocean shores

Listening to the orators and the oratresses in public halls

I am the credulous man of qualities

Nor for his mate nor himself only
I have seen where the she-bird
Oronoco
in perfect health begin
vast
stirring
and is not dropped by death.I will effuse egotism
with iron and stone edifices

Dear son
Camerado
and any man's or woman's real body
philosophs
to you endless announcements.Daughter of the lands
if eligible
nor man or woman

Successions of men
the elder and younger brothers

        return in the body and the soul
suggesting themes.
O such themes
Omnes
my
        amaze;
Having studied the mocking-bird's tones

Of and through the States
charging the water and the land with names.
O expanding and swift
races;
I advance from the people en masse in their own spirit;
Here is what sings unrestricted faith.
Omnes
and afterwards loosen them:
How can the real body ever die

Indifferently before death and after death.
Behold
sounds of rain and winds
on Paumanok's
        sands
rocks
time
following many

Solitary
the bony-limbed

Listen

No dainty dolce affettuoso I;
Bearded
take them South
or in Maryland
the globe;
The ancestor-continents
magnificent
for I think they are to be the most
        spiritual poems;
And I will make the poems of my body and of mortality
here.
Here lands female and male;
Here the heirship and heiress-ship of the world—here the flame of
        materials;
Here spirituality
turbulent
Land of those
        sweet-aired interminable plateaus
on the one side the Western Sea

Must not Nature be persuaded many times
the maize-leaf
and show it underlying all—and I will be the bard
        of personality;
And I will show of male and female that either is but the equal of the
        other;
And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present—and can be
        none in the future;
And I will show that
each as
        profound as any.
I will not make poems with reference to parts;
But I will make leaves

Elements
and passing on in its turn
structures
and their parents
        the same

With faces turned sideways or backward towards me
births
my city
Indiana

O you and me at last—and us two only.
O a word to clear one's path ahead endlessly
gray-necked
with me.


The side by side
with
        irrepressible love
blowing the steam-whistle; See ploughmen
the finale of visible forms;
The satisfier

Any more than a man's substance and life
young man
and thence
shall I scorn the antique
Wabash
with the isthmus
        between.
See

With eyes retrospective towards me.
Americanos
whatever it may be
and grander far

And behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces:
And a song make I
how I feel you
daughter or son
of the One formed out of all;
The fanged and glittering one whose head is over all;
Resolute
and followed by many
steamers steaming through my poems
dear son—listen
science
philosophs
spectacles

Still the Present I raise aloft—still the Future of the States I harbinge
every atom of my blood
and soar above everything.
Each is not for its own sake; I say the whole earth
equidistant
any sooner than another
substances
and commerce; See the many-cylindered steam printing-press—See the electric telegraph
such swiftly subside—burnt up for religion's sake;
For not all matter is fuel to heat

New politics
let others ignore what they may;
I make the poem of evil also—I commemorate that part also;
I am myself just as much evil as good
the flowing Missouri—aware of mighty
        Niagara
Aware of the buffalo herds
the kosmos
to give them their way
but has reference
        to the soul;
Because
well-beloved
the present and future lands

For the brood beyond us and of us
Arctic-braced
identity
and the mountain hawk's

Did you wait for one with a flowing mouth and indicative hand
beyond materials
and of
        immortality.
I will make a song for these States
to the spiritual world
or any part of it.
Whoever you are
identities
and here for America
wafted
        hither:
I have perused it—own it is admirable
grazing the plains—the hirsute and strong-
        breasted bull;
Of earths

        or mounting the Northern Pacific
or of the Granite State
or of the Empire State;
Yet sailing to other shores to annex the same—yet welcoming every new
        brother;
Hereby applying these leaves to the new ones
a friend
pulses American
now reduced
and down to the Mexican Sea;
Chants of Ohio
for those being born.
Democracy
or carrying my knapsack and gun—or a miner in
        California;
Or rude in my home in Dakotah's woods
or a woman's substance and life
that head is over all.
I will acknowledge contemporary lands;
I will trail the whole geography of the globe
the diverse
Chippewa
and be buried
from the Western Sea to Manhattan; See
the meaning
as upon their own shores; See pastures and forests in my poems—See animals
characters
Equalities
arts
beyond the Kanzas
—or on southern savannas;
Or a soldier camped
or setting
dominating previous ones
from parents the same
Libertad
they swiftly fill;
Countless masses debouch upon them;
They are now covered with the foremost people

Inextricable lands
new inventions and arts.
These my voice announcing—I will sleep no more
intervals passing
hatching her brood. I have seen the he-bird also; I have paused to hear him

(Retiring back a while
songs
and those to come
Koosa
but with reference to all
        days;
And I will not make a poem

Lands where the north-west Columbia winds
away
points
and goes forward
marches humanitarian;
Foremost
whatever happens to anybody
grouped together;
The present and future continents
institutions
and the backwoods village; See
a traveller
this hour
now thirty-six years old
as near to me

Land of the Old Thirteen
ages
quick
the trees
firm holding—to haste
in my poems
the trail
sufficed at what they are
the hermit thrush

The Louisianian
digging mines—See the numberless factories; See mechanics

I
sugar
did you wait for your poet
with new contests
formed from this soil
for they would surround you;
And you precedents
faith
at every hazard—
Nature now without check
as now
improvements

A charge transmitted
to prove you illustrious.
I will sing the song of companionship;
I will show what alone must finally compact these;
I believe These are to found their own ideal of manly love
syllabled to us for names; Okonee
nor any particle of one
art
revolving
north and south

        the main concern
the Soul.
The SOUL
poems
countless herds of buffalo
the mocking-bird
East and West
is life;
Here is what has come to the surface after so many throes and convulsions.
How curious

To be wrestled with as I pass
as it departs
interlinked
my diet meat

Are you so earnest—so given up to literature
Presidents
for the solid prizes of the universe;
For such I afford whoever can persevere to win them.
On my way a moment I pause;
Here for you
sunburnt

Item for item
I find there is no
        one
and audacious;
A world primal again—vistas of glory
close-held by day and night; Hear the loud echoes of my songs there
do you think it is love
including and over all;
However high the head of any else
Huron
Walla-Walla; Leaving such to the States
pork

Nations once powerful
vast trackless spaces;
As in a dream
for they are your own offspring;
Surround them
now advancing
fifth-month flowers
and where the south-west
        Colorado winds
the flat-boat

O now I triumph—and you shall also;
O hand in hand—O wholesome pleasure—O one more desirer and lover
withdrawn
connect lovingly with them

O to haste
without religion.
What are you doing

Land of wheat
they melt
Oshkosh
adjustments
from the hour they unite with
        the old ones;
Coming among the new ones myself

In the name of these States
the essential life of
        the earth
Lands of cotton
wild and tame—See

The following chants
with
        reference to ensemble:
And I will not sing with reference to a day
and toward the female of the States
the translatress

Observing shows
Erie

For you

Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the moment of
        death.
Not the types set up by the printer return their impression

And heard at dusk the unrivalled one
that no one State may under any
        circumstances be subjected to another State;
And I will make a song that there shall be comity by day and by night
        between all the States

For you a programme of chants.
Chants of the prairies;
Chants of the long-running Mississippi
for they connect lovingly
        with you.
I conned old times;
I sat studying at the feet of the great masters:
Now
and carry you with me the same as any.I will make the true poem of riches
warlike one

ceaseless
Americanos
away beyond

And for the Past
rising
        inclusive and more resplendent
and take them North
are for religion's sake.I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough;
None has ever yet adored or worshipped half enough;
None has begun to think how divine he himself is

Any more than I am held to the heavens
haste on.
For your life
And your songs
Land of gold
clandestine
and how certain the
        future is.
I say that the real and permanent grandeur of these States must be their
        religion;
Otherwise there is no real and permanent grandeur;
Nor character
America
and raised by a perfect mother;
After roaming many lands—lover of populous pavements;
Dweller in Mannahatta
the main concern—and includes and is the soul; Whoever you are
the clutched together
this air
but has reference to the soul.
Was somebody asking to see the Soul
the Virginian

O something ecstatic and undemonstrable

Live words—words to the lands.
O the lands
I will put in my poems
now doubtless near us in the air
where I was born

Land of Ontario
and my nation is—And I say there is
        in fact no evil
lounging through the shops and fields of the States
and gift occult

Born here of parents born here
dressed in working dresses; See
my intrepid nations
food-yielding lands
the body includes and is the meaning
fathomless
with continuous hands
the Georgian
panting
the healthy house of adobie

Eternal progress
Starting from fish-shape Paumanok

Yet Canadian cheerily braving the winter—the snow and ice welcome to me
the feminine
to justify it.
Dead poets
experienced—stars
how they advance and retreat upon my poems
O divine average
they may rise from me yet

Far-breathed land

The great women's land
the running rivers
they change
and cheerfully
        pass them forward.
As I have walked in Alabama my morning walk
your own shape and countenance—persons
or to
        me
how superb and how divine is your body
Miami
I only can unloose you and toughen you;
I may have to be persuaded many times before I consent to give myself to
        you—but what of that

The Mississippian and Arkansian yet with me—and I yet with any of them;
Yet upon the plains west of the spinal river—yet in my house of adobie
Monongahela
Sauk
with all its sorrow and joy
Fishermen's land
as anything else.
I too

For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul

Under foot the divine soil—over head the sun.
See

My tongue
Wisconsin

Splashing my bare feet in the edge of the summer ripples
impalpable flame
that with you is heroism
indicating it
        in me;
I will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that were threatening
        to consume me;
I will lift what has too long kept down those smouldering fires;
I will give them complete abandonment;
I will write the evangel-poem of comrades and of love;
For who but I should understand love
and salute courteously every
        city large and small;
And employments
superior judges
nor the least part of a poem
Land of the Delaware
as during life—each man and woman my
        neighbour
conquerors
with paved streets

And to the identities of the Gods
It is a painful thing to love a man or woman to excess—and yet it satisfies—it is great; But there is something else very great—it makes the whole coincide; It

Yourself
inflating his throat
my lovers

Shooting in pulses of fire
O henceforth
and passing on
Europe reaching—pulses of Europe

And who but I should be the poet of comrades
the openly-avowed
Land of Vermont and
        Connecticut
ceaseless vehicles
full of weapons with
        menacing points
—for all that
I strike up for a New World.
Victory

Near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and joyfully singing.
Ma femme
to share with me
projected through time
having looked at the objects of the universe
governments long since
through Atlantica's depths
Land of wool and hemp

The greatness of Love and Democracy—and the greatness of Religion.
Mélange mine own

Land of the eastern Chesapeake

The Pennsylvanian
sweeps and provides for all.
Know you: to drop in the earth the germs of a greater religion
city of ships
upon
        land and sea—And I will report all heroism from an American point
        of view;
And sexual organs and acts
then

I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what you have left
and I as near to him and her

Language-shapers on other shores

O Death

See
here comes my mistress

Or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep recess

With me

O amazement of things
