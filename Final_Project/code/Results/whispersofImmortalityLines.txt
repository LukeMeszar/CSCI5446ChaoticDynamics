Leaned backward with a lipless grin.
No contact possible to flesh
Allayed the fever of the bone.

The ague of the skeleton;

Stared from the sockets of the eyes!
He knew that thought clings round dead limbs
But our lot crawls between dry ribs
And saw the skull beneath the skin;

Distil so rank a feline smell
As Grishkin in a drawing-room.
And breastless creatures under ground
Expert beyond experience,
Compels the scampering marmoset
He knew the anguish of the marrow
Grishkin has a maisonette;
The sleek Brazilian jaguar

Grishkin is nice: her Russian eye
To seize and clutch and penetrate,
Circumambulate her charm;
Gives promise of pneumatic bliss.
Does not in its arboreal gloom
Tightening its lusts and luxuries.
Who found no substitute for sense;
With subtle effluence of cat;

Is underlined for emphasis;
The couched Brazilian jaguar

Uncorseted, her friendly bust
And even the Abstract Entities
To keep our metaphysics warm.
Donne, I suppose, was such another
Webster was much possessed by death
Daffodil bulbs instead of balls
