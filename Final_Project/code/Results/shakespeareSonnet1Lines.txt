Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
From fairest creatures we desire increase,
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
