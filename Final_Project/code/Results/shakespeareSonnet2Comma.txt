Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now
Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:
Then being asked
and thriftless praise.
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
Were an all-eating shame
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
To say within thine own deep sunken eyes
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count
where all thy beauty lies
and make my old excuse'
Proving his beauty by succession thine.
This were to be new made when thou art old
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
