Reach out my hand and pluck a nectarine.
Ticked off upon a clock which never stays,
Shredding our portion of Eternity,
Within a granite basin, under one
That tears our life up into bits of days
The leafy, sun-lit earth of Fantasy.
Beyond the ilex shadow glares the sun,
Which hides a world empty of hours; ways
Of space unroll, and Heaven overlays
Goaded and harassed in the factory
The bronze-gold glimmer of a carp; and I
Brown lily-pads lie heavy and supine
We break away at last, and steal the key
Scorching against the blue flame of the sky.
