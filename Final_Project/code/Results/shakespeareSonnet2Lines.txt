Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
Proving his beauty by succession thine.
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'
This were to be new made when thou art old,
