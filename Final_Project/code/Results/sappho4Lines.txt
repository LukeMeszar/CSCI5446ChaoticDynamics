O Pan of the evergreen forest,
Of human longing, with purpose
Now even I, a fond woman,
Frail and of small understanding,
With oil and honey and wheat-bread,
And thou, sea-born Aphrodite,
Colour and fashion and fragrance,
Earth, with her infinite beauty,
So often the giver of secret
Moulder of malleable music,
Glows like a flower with fervour
  Fleet yet eternal.
Helper of men at their toiling,—
O Hermes, master of knowledge,
  Pure and undarkened.
Ever to keep thy great worship
Drench with the dew of enchantment
Tillage and harvest and herding,—
Worker of wonders in metal,
This moon-white delicate body,
Touch with thy lips and enkindle
In whose beneficent keeping

Greatly desiring wisdom,
Measure and number and rhythm,
Grow to the measure of beauty
Now even I come before thee
  Hast thou not hearkened!
Praying for strength and fulfilment

Yet with unslakable yearning
Protector of herds in the meadows,
  Where woods are vernal!
  And the bright portals.
Come to the threshold of reason
How many times to frail mortals
This mortal one, that I also
  Learning to mortals!
