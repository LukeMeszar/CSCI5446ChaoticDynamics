This sort of math annoys a busy man,
When he has lots of precious time to kill:
“The space the vectors fill is called the span,
the span's the space the set of vectors fill.
A pivot is an isolated one
With zeroes up above and down below.
Row echelon is when your work is done,
With ohs before the ones in every row.
A transformation is a funny beast
Which maps a set of vectors to a range.”
I understand this much of it at least,
And I can't help it if the rest seems strange.
Nor should I be beset by pangs of guilt,  
When matrices turn out to have been tilt.
